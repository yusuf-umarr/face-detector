Face Detector

A computer vision project using OpenCV to detect faces in images and videos.

Dependencies:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pre-trained face detection data (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)

Usage:

1. Install OpenCV and import the necessary dependencies.
2. Place the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using Python (e.g., python (link unavailable)).
4. The script will detect faces in the input image and video stream from the webcam.

Input Files:

- RDJ.jpeg (image file for testing)

Output:

- Detected faces are highlighted in the output video stream.

Key Bindings:

- Press 'Q' or 'q' to quit the program.

Note:

- Adjust the face detection parameters as needed for optimal performance.
- The script uses a pre-trained face detection model, but you can train your own model for better accuracy.
